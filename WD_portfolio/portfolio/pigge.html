			<p>PIGGE is a single player stealth game that portrays the dictatorship and oppression felt in Portugal during Estado-Novo. You play as a young art student, Filip Fox, who wants to leave his revolutionary mark in the city, hoping to inspire many to claim their deserved freedom.</p>

			<p>PIGGE was initially idealized by 3 students from <a href="https://www.etic.pt/">ETIC</a> studying Animation and Videogames, whose main focus is art. They contacted me to help make their game a reality and I took part of the development team as the only programmer and a game designer.</p>
			
			<h3>Roles in the development:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Programming - The game was written in C# using Unity.</li>
				<li>Game Design - I aided the lead designer with all game design choices.</li>
			</ul>

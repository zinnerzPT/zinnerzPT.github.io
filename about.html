			<p>Hello, my name's Francisco Domingues and I'm a AGE year old game developer and programmer from Portugal.</p>
         <p>I am currently studying Videogames & Multimedia in Instituto Politécnico de Leiria and working on a couple of game projects on the side.</p>
        <p> I started playing videogames at the age of 5 when I got my first Game Boy Color with a copy of Pokémon Gold and I've always been fascinated by videogames ever since, which I played throughout my childhood along with a fair share of collectible card games, like Magic The Gathering.</p>
         <p>When it came time to pick a major I wanted to make videogames so I chose Computer Science which as it was the only accessible option, but dropped out after 3 years as a new major had opened and enroled in the Videogames & Multimedia major that I'm currently taking.</p>

				<p>Hello, my name's Francisco Domingues and I'm a <span id="age"></span> year old game developer and programmer from Portugal.</p>
				<p>I am currently studying <a href="http://games.ipleiria.pt/">Videogames & Multimedia</a> at Instituto Politécnico de Leiria and working on a couple of game projects on the side.</p>
				<p>I started playing videogames at the age of 5 when I got my first Game Boy Color with a copy of Pokémon Gold, and I've been fascinated by videogames ever since. I continued playing videogames throughout my childhood along with a fair share of collectible card games, like Magic The Gathering.</p>
				<p>When the time came for me to pick a major I decided that I wanted to make videogames so, at the time, I picked Computer Science which was the closest and best option for me to be able to pursue game development. Later on, after 3 years, I decided to drop out, as a new course was made available, one that was fully focused on making games. I then enrolled in the Videogames & Multimedia major, which I'm currently on the 3rd year of.</p>

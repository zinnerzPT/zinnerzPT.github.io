			<p>Dreamcatcher is a single player 3D puzzle game, where you play as a 14-year-old boy who is afraid of the dark. You will venture through his nightmares, explore its mazes and fight his fears to gain courage and level up in order to transform these into dreams.</p>

			<p>In this game we are presenting a great challenge for the player since the map itself is already a puzzle. So, in addition to the other puzzles, where the player must place blocks in the right place to form a symbol, the player must think about how to move if he wants to go somewhere specific.</p>

			<p>This game was developed with Unreal Engine 4 as part of a 3D Game Project class. My role in the development of this project was programming.</p>

			<p>We were graded 16 out of 20 by developing this game.</p>
